# Welcome

Hi, I'm Jorge ! This project was created for the task "Front end developer" of PlaySPORTS group, the main idea is to improve the mobile user experience.

Just in case my main github account is [https://github.com/algaba97](https://github.com/algaba97)


## How to run it

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

dev tools.

## Improvements

When I first saw the current implementation I decided that the best approach was creating a fast prototype (under 2h) of my point of view of how would the user experience could be improved based on my VOD experience.
In order to get this prototype fast I used CRA, also grouped all the css( App.css) and make some not very beautiful js workarounds, and I came up with 3 main improvements. 

## Hero

Creating a Hero (that could contain N rotating elements if properly implemented), with a simple but effective CTA, play the video, which I think is the main goal of the site.

## Reduce noise

I feel like it has too many options on the main screen:
- Social icons could be just only places
- Grouped search, shop and youtube just under the hero
- The menu is not very mobile friendly, I think it could be directly placed into rails ( video rails and publications rails).

## Rails
This rail implementation is super simple and with some could look so much better for sure, but basically, the user can quickly see the different categories and videos, and he is more likely to click on one of them
